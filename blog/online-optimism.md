This time last year, my goal on Twitter was to sound clever.
I don't remember deciding to pursue cleverness,
but when I reflected on the content of my feed, I saw no other conclusion.
At the end of 2017, I made a decision to change that.
My new goal: _be genuine and kind._
Over the last year, I've had some fun online conversations,
and I suspect this new goal played a large part.
